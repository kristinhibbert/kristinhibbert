# Welcome!

I am a college student at Arizona State University, studying Full-Stack Website Development. I aim to use my degree to create websites that fill niches in the World Wide Web, as well as to make the offline world a better place. I have learned HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, Bootstrap, and Python, and have been coding since the age of 13. My hobbies include gaming, coding, drawing, and inventing, as well as building LEGO sets and collecting trading cards.
